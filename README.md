# Optimizing Language Learning 
### Context
There is a theory in the context of language aquisition, that you need to see a word 20 times in context in order to acquire it.
In my context, I am studying Polish, and I am using the Easy Polsih youtube videos to do so. If I restricted myself to learn as much as possible in 90 days (3 months), while only watching a video a day, which would be the best videos to watch to maximize the number of words learned.
In this project I try to find the most optimal videos in order to learn the most vocabulary in the least time possible.
